## Summary
Opensource tool for visualizing and interacting with kubernetes. Is the upstream project for "[[Software/OpenLens\|Lens]]" 

## Notes
- A community extension for OpenLens has been created that adds Logs and shell etc back again.  
For now you can add it back by going to “menu  > extensions”  
Then add this extension
