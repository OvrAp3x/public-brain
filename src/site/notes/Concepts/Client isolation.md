Used in [[Wi-FI\|Wi-FI]] Networking. On Access points where where client isolation is enabled, wireless devices connected to the same access points cannot communicate with eachother. 

However, they can reach other devices on the network, including devices connected to other Wi-FI access points. [[Concepts/Port isolation\|Port isolation]] can be used to mitigate this.
